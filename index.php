        <h1>Jordan Bourdeau Portfolio</h1>

        <h2>Hello and Welcome!</h2>
        <p>This is the portfolio website for Jordan Bourdeau, rising sophomore Computer/Data Science double major at the University of Vermont.
            I will be updating this website as I grow and create more projects related to software development, data science, machine learning, 
            and anything else which I find interesting!
        </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I grew an interest in computers from a fairly young age. My grandpa had been in IT since computers had problems which needed IT people
             and I always thought it was fascinating. So, I decided to pursue a career in it and declared a computer science major! Once in college,
             I grew a strong interest in machine learning and AI. As a result, I decided to also pursue a major in data science in conjunction with
             my computer science curriculum. In addition to being a student and aspiring programmer, I also do other things (shocker!). In high school,
             I did sprints and jumps for the track team and played a few years of varsity soccer. Although I don't do team sports anymore, I've been 
             recreationally powerlifting since 2021 and have competed in 2 meets as of June, 2022. A few other interests of mine: my favorite movie is 
             Rocky IV, I am an avid enjoyer of classic rock, and love dogs!
