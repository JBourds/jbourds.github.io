                <h3>Family Business: Fall 2018 - Winter 2021</h3>
                <p>In my sophomore year in high school my family opened up a fitness center. I contributed in a variety of ways, being a part of both the construction crew
                    typically made up of just my Dad, Brother, and I, as well as doing all of the website/software management work. I helped set up and use our membership
                    management platform and also did all of the design work/maintenance for the website. This work was done prior to learning how to code and, as such, the
                    website work was done with Wix rather than being done from scratch.
