            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I grew an interest in computers from a fairly young
                age. My grandpa had been in IT since computers had problems which needed
                IT people
                and I always thought it was fascinating. So, I
                decided to pursue a career in it and declared a computer science major!
                Once in college,
                I grew a strong interest in machine learning and AI.
                As a result, I decided to also pursue a major in data science in
                conjunction with
                my computer science curriculum. In addition to being
                a student and aspiring programmer, I also do other things (shocker!).
                In high school,
                I did sprints and jumps for the track team and
                played a few years of varsity soccer. Although I don't do team sports
                anymore, I've been
                recreationally powerlifting since 2021 and have
                competed in 2 meets as of June, 2022. A few other interests of mine: my
                favorite movie is
                Rocky IV, I am an avid enjoyer of classic rock, and
                love dogs!</p>
